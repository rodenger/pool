# 42 C Piscine

This repository contains my solutions to the C Piscine at 42. Each folder corresponds to a specific day (C00 to C09), tackling fundamental concepts in the C programming language.

## 📁 Directory Structure

- `C00` – Basics: `write`, `ft_putchar`, loops, conditions
- `C01` – Functions, strings, comparisons
- `C02` – Pointers, memory manipulation
- `C03` – String operations and manipulations
- `C04` – String and number conversions
- `C05` – Recursion and factorial-based logic
- `C06` – 2D arrays, memory allocation
- `C07` – Advanced memory manipulation, split/strjoin logic
- `C08` – Structs, file operations
- `C09` – Custom standard library implementation

## 🛠 Compilation

All projects are written in C and can be compiled using `gcc`:
```bash
gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror filename.c -o output
